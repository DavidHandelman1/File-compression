Collaborated with CSUSM Professor Slott to implement a file compression and decompression system. Uses python GUI to prompt user for .txt file to be compressed,
and compresses it into .bin file. Also has decompression option, to turn .bin file back into original .txt file. When compressed from .txt to .bin, file size is reduced by up to 59% 
for very large files. Example: input.txt was 12,777 KB. Compression to .bin resulted in 7,553 KB, a reduction of around 59%.
